Group Project 1 for Laura Jordan, Minkyong Kim, Colleen Fitzgerald, Yemi Adetunji

## Description
DoorDash is one of the major competitors in the food delivery space. We pulled data from Kaggle and looked at one day's worth of delivery data for DoorDash for 4 major U.S. markets - New York City, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. Our data allowed us to look at the cumulative data as well as a regionalized view to answer 3 business questions. Those questions were:
* What was the most popular cuisine ordered on DoorDash? Did that change based on region?
* What is the breakdown of restaurant orders and non-restaurant orders? If a non-restaurant order, what was being ordered?
* Was there a correlation between delivery times and overall ratings?

## Data 
Dataset Used:
* Dataset used for analysis: DoorDash Restaurant Data - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/polartech/doordash-restaurant-data

## Data Limitations:
* Data only included one day's worth of data and for 4 markets, would have liked multiple days and nationwide.
* The ratings didn't include a breakdown of how the rating was achieved or the multiple ratings a user would have noted.
* Cuisine categorization wasn't standardized and needed some manipulation

## Key Takeaways
* New York City had the highest number of orders
* 3 of the 4 metro areas share the same top three cuisines - Mexican, American and Italian
* Boston and L.A. had the highest number of non-restaurant orders
* There wasn't a significant correlation between rating and delivery time
